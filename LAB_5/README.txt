Lab 5 report
File to watch: Adder.v and FullAdder.v
Conclusion: It is clear now that the implementation made by us of 
the 32-bit adder isn't the most efficent (spacewise and timewise). As show in the table above the number of LUT is increased (our adder design isn't the most space
efficent), and also the critical path is increased (delay and logic depth is increased respective to vivado own implementation of the adder).
